# CS461_Project_2
 
This project is incomplete.  The work was done in a single day and I struggled messing with the GUI for most of the time.  The monte carlo search tree portion is not the most accurate.  Not sure if the heuristics are incomplete or if the statistics part of it does not work correctly.  Apart from that the actual game is filled with bugs and crashes aproximately 1/10 times most likely due to the simulation portion of the game.
